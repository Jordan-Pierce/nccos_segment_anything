# xSAM

In-house version of EdgeSAM, MobileSAM, and SAM modules combined in the same API (to make life easier).

## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. 
Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision 
dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install xSAM:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Jordan-Pierce/xSAM.git
```

## Getting Started
The xSAM can be loaded in the following ways:

```python
from x_segment_anything import sam_model_registry, SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, SamPredictor

model_type = "vit_t"
model_type = "vit_b"
model_type = "vit_l"
model_type = "vit_h"
model_type = "edge_sam"

sam_checkpoint = "model_weight.pt*"

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

mobile_sam = sam_model_registry[model_type](checkpoint=sam_checkpoint)
mobile_sam.to(device=device)
mobile_sam.eval()

predictor = SamPredictor(mobile_sam)
predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

or generate masks for an entire image:

```python
from mobile_sam import SamAutomaticMaskGenerator

mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(mobile_sam)
masks = mask_generator.generate(<your_image>)
```
